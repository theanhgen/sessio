# Changelog

## 0.3.1 - 2026-07-10

- Made updates explicit with `sessions --update`; launching sessio no longer
  changes a checkout or global installation.
- Sanitized transcript-derived terminal output and hardened Ghostty resume
  argument handling.
- Made full-text results include sessions beyond the 300-item browse cap.
- Made the metadata cache path-keyed, private, atomic, and pruned on refresh.
- Added empty-home, search-cap, cache, and terminal-safety regression tests.
